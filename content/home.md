Data rarely speaks for itself. Without clear communication and a convincing argument, the theoretically rigorous and groundbreaking results you have found after months of backbreaking toil can easily be ignored.

In this class you’ll learn how to use techniques long used by storytellers, documentarians, and artists to communicate your scientific findings in a way that is effective, engaging, professional, enjoyable, and memorable.
